# Ḵutí Project – Collaborative Hazard Mitigation in Southeast Alaska

## Overview  
The **Ḵutí Project**, named after the Tlingit word for *weather*, is a five-year NSF-funded research initiative aimed at developing tools to mitigate risks associated with precipitation-induced hazards such as landslides and floods in Southeast Alaska. The project brings together atmospheric scientists, geoscientists, hydrologists, social scientists, and, most importantly, community leaders and Tribal environmental staff.

## Objectives  
The overarching goal of the Ḵutí Project is to co-develop hazard mitigation tools with six Southeast Alaska communities: **Skagway, Hoonah, Klukwan, Yakutat, Craig, and Kasaan**. Through this collaboration, the project seeks to increase local resilience and preparedness against extreme weather events.

## Methodologies  
Building upon the earlier NSF-funded **Sitka Landslide Research Project**, which developed the public hazard-awareness dashboard [sitkalandslide.org](https://sitkalandslide.org), Ḵutí applies these lessons to new communities in the region. Despite differing geographies and histories, shared challenges include the need to better forecast when and where hazards like landslides, rockfalls, and floods are likely to occur.

Key strategies include:

- **Regional-scale analysis** of storm events and collaboration with the **National Weather Service** to improve atmospheric river forecasting.  
- **Community-specific hazard assessments** and the co-development of educational and decision-support tools.  
- **Localized environmental monitoring** using innovative sensors and integration of Indigenous knowledge systems.

## Collaborative Approach  
Ḵutí centers collaboration at every stage—merging scientific research with local knowledge and leadership. The participatory framework ensures all tools are culturally relevant, community-approved, and practically useful.

## Future: SLIPP – Southeast Alaska Landslide Information and Preparedness Partnership  

In 2024, during a regional landslide workshop in Sitka, the concept of a formal regional organization was proposed to foster information-sharing and joint response planning. This led to the formation of:

### Southeast Alaska Landslide Information and Preparedness Partnership (SLIPP)  

**Mission:**  
To reduce the risk of landslide disasters in Southeast Alaska by sharing and coordinating local knowledge, current research, and mitigation through communication, advocacy, engagement, and response.

**Vision:**  
To establish a sustainable and active hub of landslide-related information by fostering:  
- Awareness and education  
- Shared resources and tools  
- Interagency and inter-community coordination

**Meetings:**  
SLIPP Community of Practice Meetings occur virtually on the **last Thursday of every month from 8–9am Alaska Time**. These are open to all and serve as a venue for research updates, partnership-building, and coordination.
