# Ḵutí Project 
### Collaborative Hazard Mitigation in Southeast Alaska

## Overview
The **Ḵutí Project**—named after the Tlingit word for *weather*—is a five-year NSF-funded initiative focused on developing tools to mitigate risks from precipitation-induced hazards such as landslides and floods in Southeast Alaska. The project brings together atmospheric scientists, geoscientists, hydrologists, social scientists, and, most importantly, community leaders and Tribal environmental staff.

## Objectives
The central aim of the Ḵutí Project is to co-develop hazard mitigation tools with six Southeast Alaska communities: **Skagway, Hoonah, Klukwan, Yakutat, Craig, and Kasaan**. Through close collaboration, the project seeks to increase local resilience and preparedness against extreme weather events.

## Methodologies
Building upon the previous NSF-funded **Sitka Landslide Research Project**, which produced the public hazard-awareness dashboard [sitkalandslide.org](https://sitkalandslide.org), Ḵutí applies these lessons to new communities across the region. Despite differing geographies and histories, shared challenges include the need to better forecast when and where hazards like landslides, rockfalls, and floods are likely to occur.

Key strategies include:
- **Regional-scale analysis** of storm events and collaboration with the **National Weather Service** to improve atmospheric river forecasting.
- **Community-specific hazard assessments** and the co-development of educational and decision-support tools.
- **Localized environmental monitoring** using innovative sensors and integrating Indigenous knowledge systems.

## Collaborative Approach
Ḵutí centers collaboration at every stage—merging scientific research with local knowledge and leadership. The participatory framework ensures all tools are culturally relevant, community-approved, and practically useful.

## Legacy
Ḵutí aims to leave a durable legacy of community-led resilience. By integrating interdisciplinary research with place-based partnerships, the project provides a model for hazard mitigation efforts across Alaska and other regions facing climate-related challenges.

## Future: SLIPP – Southeast Alaska Landslide Information and Preparedness
[Landslide risk reduction](https://seaklandslideworkinggroup.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_content=feed%3Arecommended%3Aview_publication) requires a strong network of experts, agencies, and local knowledge holders. In 2024, during a landslide-focused meeting in Sitka, the concept of a formal regional organization was proposed by communities to foster information-sharing and joint response planning.

This led to the formation of the **Southeast Alaska Landslide Information and Preparedness Partnership (SLIPP)**. The group began holding monthly working meetings to guide a strategic planning effort.

### SLIPP’s Mission
To reduce the risk of landslide disasters in Southeast Alaska by sharing and coordinating local knowledge, current research, and mitigation through communication, advocacy, engagement, and response.

### SLIPP’s Vision
To establish a sustainable and active hub of landslide-related information in Southeast Alaska. This effort blends the interests of agencies, Tribes, local governments, and others invested in landslide prevention by fostering:
- Awareness and education
- Shared resources and tools
- Interagency and inter-community coordination

### Monthly Meetings
SLIPP Community of Practice Meetings occur virtually on the **last Thursday of every month from 8–9am Alaska Time**. These sessions are open to all and serve as a venue for sharing research, forming partnerships, and coordinating across the region.
